<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As an engineering student learning web development, you already have a strong problem-solving mindset, which
  will help in coding efficient and scalable applications. Start with HTML for structuring web pages, CSS for styling, and 
  JavaScript for interactivity. Once comfortable, explore frontend frameworks like React.js for dynamic user interfaces and
  Tailwind CSS for faster styling. On the backend, learn Node.js with Express.js to handle server-side logic and databases
  like PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data management. Understanding REST APIs and authentication is crucial for secure web 
  applications. Use Git and GitHub for version control and deploy projects on platforms like Netlify or Vercel. Focus 
  on optimization, debugging, and testing to build high-performance applications. Web development blends creativity 
  with logic, making it a valuable skill for engineers. Whether you choose frontend, backend, or full-stack development,
   continuous learning and hands-on practice will accelerate your growth in the field.</p>
